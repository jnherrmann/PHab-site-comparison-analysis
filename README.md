This repo contains old physical habitat (PHab) data for the Deer Creek and Bear River watersheds.
These datasets were used in a preliminary study comparing the accuracy of results obtained from sampling using the 5- vs. 20-transect methods within a 100-meter reach.

Note that this is not the final, QC'ed version of SSI's PHab data. Please refer to the PHab folder for final physical habitat datasets and scripts.
